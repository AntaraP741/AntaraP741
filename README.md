# Hi, I'm Antara 👋

I'm a final-year engineering student with a strong interest in **software engineering, data engineering, data analytics and applied machine learning**. I like building things end-to-end from clean data pipelines to production-ready code and I care a lot about correctness, performance, and clarity.

## 🔧 What I Work With

**Languages**
- Python, SQL, C++, Java (working knowledge)

**Data & Backend**
- Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy  
- PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- ETL pipelines, data validation, schema design

**Machine Learning**
- Scikit-learn, basic deep learning workflows  
- Feature engineering, model evaluation, explainability

**Tools & Practices**
- Git, GitHub  
- Linux  
- Unit testing, config-driven design  
- Clean code, documentation-first approach

## 📌 What I'm Focused On Right Now

- Building **robust, reusable data validation and ETL modules**
- Strengthening **SQL (CTEs, window functions, performance tuning)**
- Writing **production-grade Python**, not notebooks-only code
- Preparing for **software / data engineering roles (new grad & internships)**

## 📂 Selected Work

- **Payments Funnel Analysis**  
  Analyzed transaction failures across authentication, authorization, and settlement stages using SQL and Python to quantify revenue leakage and propose fixes.

- **Config-Driven Data Validation Module**  
  Built a reusable Python module with schema enforcement, custom validation rules, and unit tests.

- **ML Projects**  
  Worked on classification and signal-processing-based ML pipelines with a focus on feature extraction and evaluation.
